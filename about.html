    <p class="p1">Skincare and makeup go hand in hand and Kylie Skin was something I dreamt up soon after Kylie Cosmetics. </p>
        <p  class="p2"> Iâ€™ve been working on this for what feels like a lifetime so I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s finally here! </p>
        <p  class="p3">  Building my makeup line from the ground up has taught me a lot and Iâ€™m so blessed with that knowledge to apply to my brand new company! </p>
            <p  class="p4"> Birthing a whole new team, manufacturing, fulfillment etc. separate from my cosmetics line was challenging but here we are! I got the best of the best for you guys!</p>
                <p  class="p5"> Everything is cruelty free, vegan, gluten free, paraben and sulfate free and suitable for all skin types. </p>
                    <p  class="p6"> Make sure you follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kylieskin/?hl=en">@kylieskin</a> to stay updated. So much love went into this. It all starts with skin. xo, Kylie  ðŸ’•</p>
